    <h2>Paneer Paradise: A Palak Delight!</h2>
    <p>Palak Paneer is one of the most popular Indian dish made with succulent Paneer cubes (Indian cottage cheese) in a smooth spinach sauce. I share two ways to make this healthy dish - a homestyle version and a restaurant style version with a charcoal smoking method (brought back on reader's demand). Both the vibrant green palak paneer recipes are made with fresh spinach leaves (palak in Hindi), aromatics, herbs and spices. Make these super delicious spinach paneer recipes with my easy step-by-step photo guide and video.

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1:</b><br>
            Melt ghee in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in garlic and cumin seed; cook until the garlic softens, about 3 minutes. Add tomato paste, ginger, 1 teaspoon garam masala, salt, onion, and water. Increase heat to medium, and stir until the tomato paste dissolves. Simmer slowly for 1 hour, adding water as needed to maintain a sauce-like consistency.</li>

        <li><b>Step 2:</b><br>
            Stir in spinach and cook until hot, about 5 minutes. Add paneer, and allow to cook an additional 5 minutes, or until hot. Pour into a serving dish and sprinkle with cilantro and remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala.
